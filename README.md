# Flappy Bird

Game currently runs with a menu screen which allows you to select to either get help, see the high scores and to quit. 
The help screen shows you how to play the game and if 'b' is pressed it takes you bak to the menu
The high score screen is basically just a stub at this point in time but it does take you to it's own screen and if 'b' is pressed it takes you bak to the menu.
