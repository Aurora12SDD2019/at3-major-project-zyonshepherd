# AT3_MajorProject

Use this repository to store all your documents, code and media assiciated with your major project.
You should also use the project tools to plan the project.
I recommend you use the wiki tool for your documents such as User Manual, Data dictionary, Structure chart, Test reports etc.
Once you start your project you should replace the text of this file with a description of your project and its current status.
